## Navigation
![Mobile Navigation](https://github.com/amberemeny/portfolio-assignment/blob/master/presentation/narrow-nav.png?raw=true)
*Mobile Navigation*
### Mockup Decisions
-   Navigation is an unordered list displayed as stacked blocks in mobile and horizontal aligned blocks in tablet and desktop.    
-   Socials are directly under the navigation as icons on mobile and as a dropdown on tablet and desktop.
    
### Components Used
-   Nav, unordered list and links - used together to create a navigation for website pages. Also uses semantically correct elements.    
-   Unordered list and images - used to create a separate socials navigation bar for mobile. Set up for ease of use for mobile users.    
-   Divs and unordered list and links - used together to create the dropdown menu on tablet and desktop. Provides visual ease for users with a larger screen as opposed to the mobile version.
